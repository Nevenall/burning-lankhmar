# Write

My very template environment for markdown projects; just fork and write!

## Compiles to Html

Uses Gulp and Markdown-It to compile markdown to html and execute other tasks such as spell checking and word counting.

## Internal Links

Includes custom tweaks to convert internal links to .md files to .html files upon compile.

## Visual Studio Code Integration

Includes vs code integration to execute Gulp tasks and a problem matcher for spell checking.
