#Design notes and ideas

todo - what if we setup a watch task which could do an occasional git commit with info like word count?  Cory doctowrow's version is python scripts called flashbake. 
it tracks various things like weather, what you are listening too, time/timezone

todo - maybe don't want to log exact locations in public commit messages, or maybe I don't care? 

Could make all my repos private?


what about existing clones and forks?


todo - need a markdown container for inline images. 
So, we could do things like dropcaps paragraph leaders. or at least size and wrap.  
todo - maybe syntax for definition lists?


What if we made the entire book one document? and we parsed the md for the hiearchy for our nav? 
It's easier to navigate docs when you are writing I find. No reason we couldn't sew them together at compile time though. That would be pretty easy. Order would be a thing though. 
Would want to supress the, one # header per doc though.
What about directories? 

If we have one doc per manuscript we could have all the md files in one repo. 

well, worth looking into anyway.
