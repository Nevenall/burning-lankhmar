### Starting Artha

3 Fate, 2 Persona

### The Supernatural

Characters may use: Faith, Art Magic, Folklore, and Blood Magic.

- Sorcery doesn't require the *Gifted* trait, but only advances with an instructor or a library and training time, not through making tests.

## Atlas of All Things

The city of 

### Cold Wastes

- Cold Wastes (viking barbarians kinds of snow bound raiders, barbarous and violent, unpredictable)
- The Great Forest (8 cities populate the great forest. They are protective of women and rather insular. Could be there's 1 or 2 general culture traits and 1 unique one per city)
- The Mingol steppes (our mongol analog. A boogyman to civilization. They are laconic and fatalistic)
- The Inner Sea
  - Shareenmar (a fairly undefined coastal city, we can make it interesting)
  - Ilthmar (a hive of scum and villainy and not in a fun way. They will grab you and sacrifice you to their Shark God)
- Lankhmar (A most ancient land of vast slave worked grain fields, and its chief metropolis, the city of Lankhmar. Lankmarts are fairly practical and tradition bound. They wouldn't think to interfere with the business of an established extortionist, for example)
- The Eastern Lands (vaguely holy lands flavored)
- Horborixen (the citadel of the king of kings. Vastly wealthy)
- Eevanmarensee (once a vast empire but now a city of people so effete and decadent they, and all their pets, have become entirely hairless)










## Tweaks for Swords & Sorcery

### Competence 

character's tend to be pretty heroic. We can ignore that bit and play more down to earth characters. Thiefs and such, or we can do something more heroical. 
some characters might well end up with gray shade somthing. Not at character creation though. 

I'm thinking everyone might get something like 3 extra general skill points. i think that's better then just an extra lifepath. Maybe. 

### Magic Items

there's not much as far as magic items go. Not something that characters keep for very long. 

### Sorcery and the Gifted Trait

What about the gifted trait? I'm not sure that it is needed. Magic tends to be large and impressive. The cloud of hate, Histomilo's strangling fog, the working in the Sea King's story. Even when mouser uses magic it's either reading a dangerous scroll and killing lots of wizards or it's killing a duke with magic. 

Lots of magic is kinda dark. There's the early white vs. black, but that doesn't really stick. Maybe there's some simplier magic being done, but it seems to be fairly dangerous stuff to fool with. 

It might be that blood magic is a thing. Personal suffering adding to your sorceries.
